In-class Presentation Date: 12/2/21
Report Due Date: 12/7/21
Description: You will be assigned into groups of four or five. In these groups you will be asked
to create an original presentation and report that showcases your exploratory data analyses skills
around one research question or topic. We will have lectures and work sessions during class time
to assist along the way, but you will need to put in time outside of class to complete. You must
keep a tidy repository for your group on Github (adding me to the group repo). Your group repo
should include a folder for raw data to cleaned, a folder containing your cleaned data, a folder
containing your results/primary analyses, and a folder for your final presentation and written
project. Once you have set your repo up and added me to your group repo, the project will
proceed as follows:
1. Step One: Find Data/Select a Research Topic
a. Your group must find, clean, wrangle all data necessary for your report.
b. You must identify an overarching question/topic for your analyses. This should
shape what kinds of data you decide to collect. We will workshop questions in
class. Example question: “What are the factors that are related to data science job
availabilities?”
c. Your data must be approved by me in class. I am very flexible on this, simply
need to make sure that what you’ve picked will “work” in sufficient time and
challenge you enough on the coding front. Example data: Glassdoor data on data
science jobs.
d. Place all raw, unchanged data in a “Pre-processing” folder.
2. Step Two: Clean and Wrangle the Data
a. In the second “Clean Data” folder, provide a final master data csv file that is the
cleaned data file you plant to use for your primary analyses (if you perform
analyses on subsets of the data, include the whole data).
b. Include all code (well-annotated) that you used clean and wrangle the data to
create the master csv file from the raw data files in the Pre-processing folder.
c. Include a data dictionary file that includes the name of all variables and a
description of what the variables are.

3. Step Three: Analyses
a. Transform or manipulate (at minimum) 2 variables in the data set to create new
variables. Explain why you transformed these variables in this way. Example,
creating a variable for Day and Night from an original variable that was just time

of day. Explore the distributions of the original and new variables in well-labeled
and well-designed plots.
b. Perform 3-5 analyses related to your topic or overall question. Each analysis
should ask a specific question about the relationship between two (or more)
variables in your data. Each analysis should be presented in well-labeled and
well-designed plots. Each analysis needs to help answer your broad guiding
question from Step One.
c. This means your report/presentation should have a minimum of 7-10 plots.
d. Include well-annotated code explaining each step.
4. Step Four: Report and Presentation
a. Prepare a 10-minute slide show that presents your main question/topic, discusses
the data you have collected and your data collection process, presents 1 of your
variable transformations, presents 2 of your analyses, presents a slide on
conclusions from your report, and finally a slide on briefly what you consider the
limitations of your work and what you would do to improve on your project. This
will be presented in class 12/2/21. Slides should be pushed to your group Git
report folder by 12/7/21 at 11:59pm.
b. Prepare a written report on your group project. The written report should include
an introduction to your question/topic/report, a detailed discussion of your data
collection process, a detailed discussion and presentation of your variable
transformations, sections on each of your analyses including: justifications for
why you did the analysis and detailed discussions of the results of the analyses, a
conclusion section, and a section discussing the limitations of your work and what
you’d do to improve the project if you had more time. This must be pushed to
your Final Report repo on Github by 12/7/21 at 11:59pm.
